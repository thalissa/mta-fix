# Mage the Awakening 2e for FoundryVTT

2nd edition of Mage the Awakening by White Wolf, set in the Chronicles of Darkness.
I am currently trying to get support for Changeling and Werewolf running, so I can have this be a proper 'Chronicles of Darkness' system.

Manifest: https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta/-/raw/master/system.json

If someone wants to help with development, you're always welcome.
I'll continue working on this until I'm done with my current campaign,
though if people are interesting I might continue afterwards.

Dev branch will possibly be unstable, homebrew branch is for my personal homebrew and the place where most features originate.

If you want to support the project, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/soulcake) :)

### Supported Sheets
* Mortals (CofD)
* Mages (MtAw 2e)
* Vampires (VtR 2e)
* Changelings (CtL 2e)
* Sleepwalkers
* (Proximi)
* Ephemeral Entities (Goetia, Angel, Ghost, Spirit)

### Current Features

* Sheets for Spells, Active Spells, Attainments, Yantras, Firearms, Melee, Armor, Ammo, Equipment, Services, Merits, Conditions, Tilts, ...
* Tracking of pretty much all the things the original character sheet contains
* Rolling of any combination of Attribute, Skill, and other trait
* Complete dice roller with all rules (e.g. 10-/9-/8-again, rote pools, chance die removing 10-again, and 1-again for rote pools)
* Dice penalties for 0 dots in Skills
* Intelligent health tracking (kudos to Pecklaaz)
* Reloading system from my TAC System (might be a bit over-the-top but it works), in order to reload you have to have ammo your inventory with the same cartridge as the firearm
* Basic Doors/Impression tracking
* Quick calculation of derived stats
* Weapon rolling
* Mage: (Improvised) spell casting! With almost all features as the one on voidstate.com (except Yantras)!
* Beat tracking system (with history, and reasons, etc.)

### Currently Working On

* Proximi sheets
* Werewolf sheets
* Synchronising Tilts with token status effect icons
* Tracking of temporary stat boni
* Mage: Relinquishing spells
* Supernal entity sheets
* Equipment rolling (?)

### Planned Features

* Mage: Saving spell template to easily re-cast spells with specific factors
* Complete support of special merits that influence derived traits (currently only Defensive Combat)
* Some sort of small wiki of the features
* Sheets for most other CoD splats
* Perhaps a Compendium without any descriptions

Unfortunately, due to White Wolf's licensing, I'm pretty sure I can't publish a Compendium.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
